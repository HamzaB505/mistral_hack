While it doesn't have added sugars, natural sugars can still impact your blood glucose levels. As someone managing diabetes, it's important to monitor carbohydrate and sugar intake to maintain stable blood sugar levels.\n\n**Explanation using your personal data**\n\nYour recent lab results indicate a fasting blood sugar level of 158 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 8.2%, which are above the target ranges for individuals with diabetes. Your current diet is high in carbohydrates and sugars, and you rarely exercise, both of which can contribute to elevated blood glucose levels. Consuming this product could further increase your blood sugar, making it harder to manage your condition.\n\n**Comparison with a healthy individual**\n\nA healthy person of the same age, height, and weight would typically have a fasting blood sugar level below 100 mg/dL and an HbA1c below 5.7%. Their body can regulate blood sugar more effectively, so consuming natural sugars has less impact on their overall glucose levels. In contrast, your body may not process sugars as efficiently due to insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nIt might be helpful to consult your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to determine if this product fits into your meal plan. They can provide personalized advice based on your current health status and help you make dietary choices that support better blood sugar control."
